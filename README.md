# A Star Graph

This program runs the A Star search algorithm on 100 random mazes created with a binary grid that can be asbig as 100 by 100 and generates an unsearched graph and a copy of that graph after the A Star Algorithm was performed that displays the path the searcher would take.  

Key: Black represents a wall in the maze while white is an unblocked and unsearched spot.  Yellow is the goal state, green is a spot remaining in the openj list (unsearched), red is the closed list(searched and removed from list), and orange is the agents initial state, blue is the optimal path found.
